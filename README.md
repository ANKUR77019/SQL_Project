# SQL Job Market Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts designed to analyze job market trends using structured query language (SQL). The analysis focuses on identifying high-paying roles, in-demand skills, and optimal skill combinations, particularly for **Data Analyst** positions.

The project is implemented using **PostgreSQL** and demonstrates practical usage of advanced SQL concepts such as joins, common table expressions (CTEs), aggregations, and filtering.

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To identify top-paying job roles in the job market
- To analyze the skills associated with high-paying jobs
- To determine which skills are most in demand
- To find skill combinations that maximize salary potential for Data Analyst roles

## SQL Files Description

### 1. `1_top_paying_jobs.sql`
Identifies the highest-paying job roles based on salary data.  
This script helps understand which roles offer the best compensation.

---

### 2. `2_top_paying_job_skills.sql`
Analyzes the skills required for top-paying jobs.  
Focuses on mapping high salaries to relevant technical skills.

---

### 3. `3_top_demanded_skills.sql`
Finds the most in-demand skills across job postings.  
Useful for understanding current market demand.
